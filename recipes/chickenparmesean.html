        <h3>Enjoy a classic Italian-American favorite.</h3>
        <p> Crispy breaded chicken breasts topped with marinara sauce and melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Perfectly served over pasta or with a side of garlic bread for a comforting and delicious meal.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness: Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the thick part down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Don't skimp on seasoning: Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs: Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken, the Parmesan will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>
            <li>Rest before cooking: Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to adhere to the chicken breast.</li>
            <li>Go easy on the sauce: THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a good thing is too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?</li>
            <li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot: Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the breading to crisp up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.</li>
        </ol>
